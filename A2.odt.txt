Evidencing A2: Teach and/or support learning
This Area of Activity is about your direct engagement with learners
whether in groups or individually. These encounters may be in a wide
range of environments, such as classrooms, seminar rooms, lecture
theatres, labs, learning support centres, offices, professional settings,
etc.
Your teaching activities might include for example, lecturing, tutorial
and seminar work, studio, clinical, laboratory or workplace-based
teaching, distance learning and the use of virtual learning environments.
The support you give might include, for example, teaching and supervision
of postgraduates, mentoring inexperienced staff or contributing to inhouse learning and teaching programmes.
Address the following points in this section of your account by
critically reflecting on:
1. The main ways in which you teach and/or support learners (â‰¤ 100
words)
2. The activities or techniques you use and why
3. How you came to use them and why you think they were successful in
supporting student learning? Give reasons for your choice of activities
and techniques and how they relate to developing the learners'
understanding of the subject
4. Which elements of Core Knowledge did you utilise, how and why
5. Which Professional Values were particularly relevant and why

I engage with learners through lectures, peer instruction, running
computing labs, supervising post-graduate students and I have recently
started to make teaching videos in order to flip the classroom. For
brevity, I will not discuss graduate student supervision.
Since I started teaching numerical methods in 2011, I have taken steps to
ensure that all students are engaged in lectures, not just the top few
who are prepared to answer questions. I therefore use hand-outs with gaps
so that all students are invited to engage and try to answer questions
(Professional value V2). I have had mostly positive feedback from
students about the notes with gaps but it is clear that it is not perfect
– there are still students who do not engage or who just cannot answer
the questions. I have therefore recently started to use peer instruction
with multiple choice questions and think-pair-share sessions, due to the
wealth of evidence supporting the efficacy of this technique (eg Mazur
and Somers, 1999) (V3). I have tried a high tech approach using a
specialised website (mqclicker.com) and asking students to bring their
smartphones to class. This was popular with students (evidenced by
feedback at the staff-student forum) but very time consuming, both to set
up and during the class. I have therefore moved to a low-tech approach;
asking students to show 1, 2, 3 or 4 fingers against their chest to
answer questions. This is much quicker and also allows me to ask
questions when they arise during class without the need for painstaking
preparation. This therefore appears to be an appropriate technology (K4).
The questions that I ask are usually answered correctly by less than half
of the class at the first attempt and by well over half after peer
instruction. This demonstrates that the questions are at the appropriate

level for the academic programme (K2).
I try to avoid asking questions for volunteers to answer during lectures
as this only engages a small fraction of the class. I also avoid picking
on students to answer questions. If I pick on a strong student then I am
not engaging with the weaker students whereas if I spotlight a weak
student who cannot answer then I risk humiliating them. (Professional
value V1.) I also ask students to nominate each other to answer questions
based on their peer interactions. This was a technique highlighted in a
university training course on “Enhancing Teaching, Engaging Learners:
Personalising Teaching to Deepen Learning”, October 2014. By asking
students to nominate each other to talk, I would like to hear from a
larger fraction of the class. This has not, so far, been as effective as
I would have liked.
I take computing labs in which students undertake programming exercises
and ask questions. Since taking over this course, I have provided more
example code for the students to copy and modify in order to teach them
good programming style. When I took over the course, the students were
expected to code everything from scratch. They complained about this and
they handed in some wild and impenetrable code. I now give them more
scaffolding (Coffey 2015); some code to start with, and they have to find
where they need to add code. This means that they learn good programming
style by reading the code that I have given them and they do not spend
time designing bad code because I have provided them with a good
framework. The scaffolding is taken away in the more advanced module in
the following term, in which the students have to write code from
scratch.
I have very recently started to make SHORT teaching videos and screen
casts:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO0YwmerBCvW-BrR8kcjLzw in order to flip
the classroom and free up class time for peer instruction. I have tried
to avoid having to make these videos myself by searching for videos that
others have made on similar topics but I have always found other people's
videos to be too long (eg 50 minutes rather than 10 minutes). I have
found videos to be a good way of learning material myself and I have had
some positive informal feedback from students about my videos. I am
hoping that the videos will be particularly helpful for students whose
English comprehension is weak so that they can re-wind and try to
understand what I am saying (professional values V1 and V2).
