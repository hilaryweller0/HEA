Evidencing A4: Develop effective learning environments and approaches to
student support and guidance
This Area of Activity is about how you make effective use of both the
formal and informal learning environment to facilitate learning, and how
you seek to meet the needs of your learners for educational support and
guidance. It includes how you:
Utilise and manage the full range of physical or virtual learning
environments so that they are appropriate to your learnersâ€™ needs
Work with learners and service providers to ensure that your learners can
access and use a broad range of learning opportunities. Learner support
might include such activities as personal and academic tutoring, one-toone advice, counselling, developing practice to meet the learning
implications of widening access, or supporting learners with disabilities
Use examples from your practice where you have utilised the learning
environment and/or provided support and guidance to your learners.
Address the following points in this section of your account by
critically reflecting on:
1. The main types of educational environment in which you work and/or
what kinds of support and guidance you give to your learners, whether
formal or informal (â‰¤ 100 words)
2. How you have contributed to making the learning environment more
effective for learners
3. The ways you have contributed to supporting and guiding your learners
4. Why you chose those particular strategies and how well they worked
5. Which elements of Core Knowledge you used, how and why
6. Which Professional Values you applied, how and why

The physical environments in which I work are classrooms and PC labs. I
also use virtual environments - the courses I teach have discussion
forums on which I answer questions about the coursework very promptly.
What does very promptly mean? Pros and cons of this approach could be
elaborated on. I also offer one to one or group support during office
hours.
I have contributed to making the learning environment more effective by
encouraging students to ask questions on the discussion forum rather than
emailing me. These questions can be asked anonymously, thus respecting
individual learners (V1). The students benefit because they can learn
from the questions of other students. This is an appropriate use of a
learning technology (K4) and it is also a method of evaluating the
effectiveness of my teaching (K5). I am also applying professional values
V1 and V2; by making all of these questions and answers visible to all
students, all can benefit from them, not just the self confident students
who are prepared to ask questions. Demonstrate that it is used?
I support learners who are not fluent in English (V1 and V2) by ensuring
that all important communications are written down so that they do not
have to rely on understanding me talking. This also recognises the wider
context in which higher education operates (V4). We are trying to attract
more students from overseas and so we must provide them with teaching
material that is comprehensible. Is that the only thing we need to do? Is
it worth elaborating here at all?

I am interested in the idea of stereotype inoculation (eg Jaschick 2011).
I am a white woman so I hope to inoculate the class against the idea that
women cannot do mathematics and computing. Many of my students are Asian
and I have provided them with a role model by conducting a skype
interview during a lecture with an Asian member of staff at the Met
Office about career prospects in atmospheric science.
I have not always been able to learn the names of all my students.
However I understand that this is important for providing an inclusive
environment. I plan to do this better in future years by interviewing all
students about their background and how to pronounce their name during
the first practical computing session of the term. Can you identify a way
to make you more likely to remember these - with evidence (and if you
find one that's good can you share it with me please!)
