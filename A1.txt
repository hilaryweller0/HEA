Evidencing A1: Design and plan learning activities and/or programmes of study

This Area of Activity refers to all your professional educational activities where you are preparing for engagement with learners. For example you might:

    Design or redesign curricula, courses and programmes of study

    Identify and plan different kinds of interaction with learners in various contexts, whether for single sessions or larger programmes

    Participate in validation panels

    Contribute to the creation of learning resource packs and computer-based or open learning materials or the development of virtual learning environments

Address the following in this part of your account by critically reflecting on:
1. The main ways in which you design and plan learning activities and/or programmes of study (≤ 100 words)

2. The reasons for your choice of:
a. subject material
b. activities and techniques
c. the particular learning technologies included in your plan

3. How your choices facilitate your students’ learning in general and within their subject area

4. At least one of the other Dimensions of the Framework for example:

- Which elements of Core Knowledge did you utilise and why
- Which Professional Values were particularly relevant and why

I design and plan learning activities based on my experience of teaching similar material, my experience taking courses which include similar material, based on the training I have received in STEM teaching (https://www.coursera.org/course/stemteaching), discussions with colleagues and attending teaching sessions at conferences. I aim to plan learning activities so that ALL of the students are engaged in the instructional activities and so that there is frequent feedback from myself and from peers. Before asking students to embark on an activity, I give them a short lecture (10-15 minutes) providing some motivation and the information that they will need for the instructional activity. After the class activity, I will ask the class for answers to questions based on their activities and welcome questions from them.

I chose subject material based on the prior knowledge of the students, requirements of employers, necessary pre-requisites for other courses in my department and for undertaking a PhD. I chose subject material that builds gradually so that no lecture stands alone, all parts of the curriculum are related to other parts. So if I plan to teach a difficult subject towards the end of the course, we will have covered similar, easier topics near the beginning.

2b.
As an example to answer this question, I have started to use peer instruction with multiple choice questions, with first some time for each student to answer the question individually, and then time for the students to discuss with peers and answer again. I have adopted this technique for two reasons. Firstly due to the wealth of evidence supporting the efficacy of peer instruction (eg Peer Instruction, A User's Manuel by Eric Mazur) and secondly from my own teaching and learning experience, seeing that all learners (including myself) need to attempt to answer questions while they are learning new material and that the lecturer is not always the best person to offer instruction to someone who is being exposed to concepts for the very first time.

2c.
When embarking on peer instruction with multiple choice questions, I first wrote questions on a specialised website:
https://mqlicker.com/user
and asked the students to bring smartphones in order to answer the questions. However I found this technique to be cumbersome and time consuming. Firstly, all the questions must be carefully uploaded to this website and secondly, the students spent longer than I expected in accessing the website and answering the questions. I have now adopted a low-tech approach, as recommended by xxx such as asking students to show 1,2,3 or 4 fingers on their chest to answer a multiple choice question so that I can see their answers but they cannot see each other's answers. 

3. Careful attention to students' prior knowledge and building a curriculum gradually, ensuring at each stage that students have the right prior knowledge, means that students do not get so overwhelmed by the new material that I am teaching them. For example, before we use complex numbers in my course, I give the students a complex numbers worksheet so that, when we come to use them, the students are focussing on the new area of mathematics rather than trying to remember how to manipulate complex numbers. 

The students I have taught like to be able to reflect on the multiple-choice questions after the class and ask more questions about them on the class discussion forum and in later classes. So it appears that this technique has facilitated deeper learning.

The low-tech classroom using fingers rather than clickers or smartphones to answer multiple choice questions has facilitated a larger volume of learning because we can get through more questions that way and I can ask ad-hoc questions during a class, perhaps based on a question from a student, rather than having everything planned in advance.
