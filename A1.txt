Evidencing A1: Design and plan learning activities and/or programmes of study

This Area of Activity refers to all your professional educational activities where you are preparing for engagement with learners. For example you might:

    Design or redesign curricula, courses and programmes of study

    Identify and plan different kinds of interaction with learners in various contexts, whether for single sessions or larger programmes

    Participate in validation panels

    Contribute to the creation of learning resource packs and computer-based or open learning materials or the development of virtual learning environments

Address the following in this part of your account by critically reflecting on:
1. The main ways in which you design and plan learning activities and/or programmes of study (≤ 100 words)

2. The reasons for your choice of:
a. subject material
b. activities and techniques
c. the particular learning technologies included in your plan

3. How your choices facilitate your students’ learning in general and within their subject area

4. At least one of the other Dimensions of the Framework for example:

- Which elements of Core Knowledge did you utilise and why
- Which Professional Values were particularly relevant and why

I design programmes of study using backward design; starting with the learning goals; what I want the students to be able to do by the end of the course. Learning goals are then broken down into learning objectives; what I want the students to be able to do after each topic of the module. These objectives inform the assessments and the assessments inform the choice of instructional activities so that the instruction, assessments and learning objectives are aligned. This is a widely accepted, evidence informed approach (eg "Understanding by Design" by Wiggins and McTighe, 1988), demonstrating professional value V3. 

I initially choose subject material based on requirements of prospective employers (acknowledging the wider context in which HE operates, value V4), based on requirements of undertaking a PhD in a science subject (so I teach some data analysis), to provide pre-requisites for other modules and based on my own research interests. These choices require core knowledge K1 and these choices inform the course level learning goals. The specific learning objectives are designed to take students gradually from their very varied prior knowledge to the course level learning goals. 

One of the activities I use is peer instruction with multiple choice questions and think-pair-share sessions, due to the wealth of evidence supporting the efficacy of this technique (eg "Peer Instruction, A User's Manual" by Eric Mazur) (V3). I have tried a high tech approach using a specialised website (mqclicker.com) and asking students to bring their smartphones to class. This was popular with students but very time consuming, both to set up and during the class. I have therefore moved to a low-tech approach; asking students to show 1, 2, 3 or 4 fingers against their chest to answer questions in private. This is much quicker and also allows be to ask questions when they arise during class without the need for painstaking preparation. This therefore appears to be an appropriate technology (K4). The questions than I ask are usually answered correctly by less than half of the class at the first attempt and by well over half after peer instruction. This demonstrates that the questions are at the appropriate level for the academic programme (K2). 

I am careful in my planning to identify the necessary prior knowledge for each of the learning objectives. If I do not do this, then students are overwhelmed by both the introduction of a new subject (such as stability analysis) and the use of an unfamiliar mathematical technique (such as complex numbers). Therefore, before we use complex numbers in my course, I give the students a complex numbers worksheet so that they can familiarise or remind themselves with the techniques. Then, when I am teaching stability analysis, the students are focussing on the stability analysis rather than on the use of complex numbers. This careful planning facilitates the student's learning within the subject area (K3). 

Say something about:
V1: respecting individual learners and diverse learning communities
V2: Promoting participation in higher education and equality of opportunity for learners

(avoid spot-lighting)
everything written down for non-English speakers
revision worksheets for those from diverse educational backgrounds
clear instructions for coursework - for non-natives
ask peers to nominate each other to share, after pairing
interview all students during 1st practical session
motivation and stereotype innoculation - I am a woman and I interview Mohamed from the Met Office

Use of technologies - visuals - animations to complement speach and the provide motivation
